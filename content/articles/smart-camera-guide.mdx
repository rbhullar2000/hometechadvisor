## Types of Smart Cameras

**Indoor Cameras:**  
Designed for inside your home, these cameras prioritize aesthetics, plug-in convenience, and basic motion alerts. Some include pan-and-tilt functionality and two-way talk.

**Outdoor Cameras:**  
Built with weatherproofing, higher durability, and often equipped with spotlights or sirens. These are ideal for driveways, backyards, and entrances.

**Floodlight Cameras:**  
Combines powerful LED lighting with HD cameras. Great for backyards and large open areas.

**Battery-Powered Cameras:**  
Wire-free and easy to mount, these cameras rely on rechargeable batteries. Ideal for renters or areas without nearby outlets.

**Wired Cameras:**  
These plug into continuous power for 24/7 operation, typically more reliable but require installation planning.

**Solar Cameras:**  
Wireless cameras with solar panels for trickle-charging batteries. Ideal for long-term setups in sunny outdoor locations.

## Video Quality and Field of View

Resolution has improved over the years, and in 2025, most smart cameras support at least 1080p. Here’s what you’ll find:

- **1080p Full HD:** Still common and sufficient for most use cases.
- **2K & 2K HDR:** Improved sharpness and clarity, better for facial recognition and license plate capture.
- **4K Ultra HD:** Found in high-end models, these offer extremely detailed footage but require strong bandwidth and storage.

Field of view determines how much area the camera can see. Wide-angle lenses (120°–180°) are great for entryways and yards.

## Power Options

**Plug-in:**  
Reliable for indoor use, ensures constant operation.

**Battery-powered:**  
Highly flexible and great for outdoor areas. Battery life ranges from a few weeks to 1+ year depending on brand and usage.

**Solar-powered:**  
Perfect for remote spots where running cables isn’t practical. Best performance in sunny regions.

**PoE (Power over Ethernet):**  
High-end wired setups for those wanting professional-level reliability and data transfer.

## Smart Platform Compatibility

Choose cameras that work with your existing ecosystem:

- **Alexa:** Widely supported. Enables live view on Echo Show, motion routines, and alerts.
- **Google Assistant:** Allows voice control, Chromecast viewing, and integration with Nest hubs.
- **Apple HomeKit:** Secure integration with Home app. Look for **HomeKit Secure Video** for encrypted iCloud storage.
- **IFTTT and SmartThings:** For automation lovers wanting complex routines.

## AI Features and Alerts

Advanced cameras use AI to reduce false alerts and provide smarter notifications. Look for:

- **Person Detection**
- **Package Detection**
- **Vehicle Detection**
- **Pet/Baby Sound Alerts**
- **Activity Zones**
- **Facial Recognition** (available on premium models)

---

## Local vs Cloud Storage

**Cloud Storage:**
- Accessible from anywhere
- Subscription often required
- Useful for sharing clips
- May raise privacy concerns

**Local Storage:**
- Stored on microSD cards or base stations
- No monthly fees
- May limit remote access
- Safer for privacy-conscious users

**Hybrid Options:**
Some cameras let you choose. For example, Eufy and Reolink offer both.

---

## Privacy Considerations

With increasing surveillance, privacy matters. Choose brands that offer:

- **Two-Factor Authentication**
- **Encrypted Video Transmission**
- **Local Storage Support**
- **Privacy Shutters or Recording Schedules**

Apple’s HomeKit Secure Video offers the most secure solution, encrypting all footage before it leaves your device.
