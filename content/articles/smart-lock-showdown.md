## Smart Lock Face-Off: August vs Schlage

When upgrading your home security, a smart lock is one of the best investments you can make. Two of the most prominent names in the market—**August** and **Schlage**—offer strong but very different options. In this detailed comparison, we break down their **design philosophies**, **installation complexity**, **smart integrations**, **security features**, and more to help you decide which one is right for your smart home setup.

## 🔍 Overview: Who Are These For?

**August Smart Lock (4th Gen with Wi-Fi Bridge)**:  
Best for renters or homeowners who want a sleek, **invisible retrofit** with strong app support. Ideal if you want to keep your existing deadbolt hardware while gaining remote access and automation.

**Schlage Encode Smart WiFi Deadbolt**:  
Great for homeowners who want a **keypad lock** with **built-in Wi-Fi**, **no bridge**, and **enterprise-grade security**. Perfect for short-term rental hosts, busy families, or anyone who prefers code-based access over smartphone unlocking.

## 🔧 Installation: Retrofit vs Replacement

### **August**
- **Install Time**: ~10 minutes
- **Tools Required**: None (basic screwdriver optional)
- **Process**: Mounts inside over the existing deadbolt thumbturn.
- **Skill Level**: Beginner-friendly; no door modification needed.

The August lock excels here. You keep your existing deadbolt (and keys), and the smart unit simply attaches over the interior lock. No drilling or replacing parts. Ideal for renters or anyone hesitant about permanent changes.

### **Schlage**
- **Install Time**: ~25–30 minutes
- **Tools Required**: Screwdriver, possibly chisel (for some older doors)
- **Process**: Complete removal of the old deadbolt; installs a full smart deadbolt.
- **Skill Level**: Intermediate. Not hard, but more hands-on.

Schlage requires you to fully replace your door's lock, including the latch and strike plate. The payoff is a fully integrated, tamper-resistant unit with a keypad and built-in Wi-Fi.

✅ **Winner: August** (for ease)  
🏆 **Winner: Schlage** (for robustness)

## 🎨 Design & Aesthetics

### **August**
- **Appearance**: Round, minimalist disc with aluminum finish
- **Visible from outside?**: No—looks like a regular keyhole
- **Color Options**: Silver, black

### **Schlage**
- **Appearance**: Traditional keypad with touchscreen and keyhole
- **Visible from outside?**: Yes—keypad and branding are front and center
- **Color Options**: Aged bronze, satin nickel, matte black

August blends in seamlessly—no one will know it's a smart lock unless they’re inside. Schlage, meanwhile, makes its presence known and projects a secure, high-tech look from the curb.

- Discreet? Go August  
- Bold and secure? Go Schlage
